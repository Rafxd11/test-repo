    First of all, I thank God that I met you. It is hard to find someone who can accept your Imperfections, Attitudes, Moods, 
It is hard to find someone who can make your trust alive again, I really appreciate your ''Impact'' in my miserable life. 
I decided to dedicate this essay to you, for my appreciation to your existence in my life. You know, I don't believe in Love anymore, 
I was afraid that if I try to love again I'll ending up like on my past. My faith in Love is slowly fading. However,
you came to my life unexpectedly, and that was a nice accident. You changed my perspectives about certain things, I learned so much to you, Yes, you're not perfect, but I see that you are trying
your best. I want you to know that I am so proud of you! I want to assure you that you'll always have me, I'll be your 
''Kakampi sa lahat'' if you feel everyone's against to you. Words aren't enough to express my thankfulness to your existence, baby.
I feel safe when I am with you. I like to spend my free time with you, I don't want anyone but you. It feels so illegal to do 
such a crazy things like this. But, I would risk it all for you. After all, You deserve all the happiness in this world. 
You're worthy of all, Ash. I keep looking forward to our promises that we'll see each other when you are not busy na.
Sorry if sometimes I am so reckless towards my actions, I just want you to know that I'm trying my best to be better for you.
Because after all, You turned this ''Boy'' to a ''Man'' and you give a life out of this miserable life. 
I am so happy that I can call you mine, I'm so lucky to have you. I love you and goodluck to your goals, We will achieve all of our dreams
together. I love you!
